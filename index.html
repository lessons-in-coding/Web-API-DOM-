          <h2 id="title">Web API (Frontend API):</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Web API, also known as the frontend API, is typically
              implemented in client-side code (e.g., JavaScript) and runs in the
              user's web browser or client application.
            </li>
            <li>
              It facilitates communication between the client application (such
              as a web browser or mobile app) and external services or
              server-side APIs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Web API sends requests to the server-side API to retrieve or
              manipulate data, and handles responses from the server-side API to
              update the user interface or trigger other actions in the client
              application.
            </li>
            <li>
              Examples of Web APIs include JavaScript APIs for interacting with
              the DOM (Document Object Model), browser APIs for accessing device
              features (such as geolocation or camera), and third-party APIs for
              integrating external services into a client application.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 id="title">Server-Side API (Backend API):</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The server-side API, also known as the backend API, is implemented
              on the server-side of a web application and runs on the web
              server.
            </li>
            <li>
              It exposes endpoints (URLs) that client applications can send
              requests to, typically using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT,
              DELETE.
            </li>
            <li>
              The server-side API processes requests from client applications,
              performs business logic, accesses databases or external services,
              and returns responses to the client.
            </li>
            <li>
              Examples of server-side APIs include RESTful APIs, SOAP APIs,
              GraphQL APIs, and custom backend APIs implemented in server-side
              programming languages like Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, or C#.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            In summary, while the Web API (frontend API) handles interactions
            and requests from the client-side, the server-side API (backend API)
            processes those requests, performs operations, and returns responses
            to the client-side. Together, they form the foundation of
            communication and interaction in a web application.

        <article class="frontEnd">
          <p>
            Web API stands for Application Programming Interface that allows
            different software applications to communicate with each other over
            the internet. In the context of web development, a Web API typically
            refers to a set of rules and protocols that enable interaction
            between a client (such as a web browser) and a server.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Here's a breakdown of what a Web API is and its key components:</p>
          <br />

          <h2 id="title">What is a Web API?</h2>
          <p>
            A Web API provides a way for different software systems,
            applications, or services to interact with each other over the web.
            It defines a set of rules and protocols that govern how requests and
            responses are exchanged between a client and a server.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2 id="title">Key Components of a Web API:</h2>
          <h3>Endpoints:</h3>
          <p>
            Endpoints are specific URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) where
            clients can access the functionality provided by the API. Each
            endpoint represents a different operation or resource.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>HTTP Methods (Verbs):</h3>
          <p>
            HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., are used to
            indicate the type of operation being performed on a resource. For
            example, a GET request retrieves data from the server, while a POST
            request submits data to be processed.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Request and Response Formats:</h3>
          <p>
            Web APIs define the format of requests and responses exchanged
            between clients and servers. Common formats include JSON (JavaScript
            Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language).
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Authentication and Authorization:</h3>
          <p>
            APIs may require authentication and authorization mechanisms to
            ensure that only authorized users or clients can access certain
            resources or perform specific actions.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Documentation:</h3>
          <p>
            Good API documentation is essential for developers to understand how
            to use the API effectively. Documentation typically includes
            information about endpoints, request and response formats,
            authentication methods, and usage examples.
          </p>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <br />

          <h2 id="title">Examples of Web APIs:</h2>
          <h3>RESTful APIs:</h3>
          <p>
            Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are a popular
            architectural style for designing web APIs. They use HTTP methods
            and resource URLs to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
            operations on resources.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>GraphQL APIs:</h3>
          <p>
            GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to specify
            exactly what data they need. Unlike REST APIs, which expose fixed
            endpoints, GraphQL APIs provide a single endpoint that clients can
            use to request custom data.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Third-Party APIs:</h3>
          <p>
            Many companies and services offer APIs that allow developers to
            integrate their functionality into third-party applications.
            Examples include social media APIs (e.g., Twitter API, Facebook
            Graph API), payment APIs (e.g., PayPal API, Stripe API), and mapping
            APIs (e.g., Google Maps API).
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Understanding Web APIs is essential for web developers as they often
            need to integrate external services or build their own APIs to
            enable communication between different parts of a web application.
            Learning how to consume and create APIs will open up a wide range of
            possibilities for building powerful and interconnected web
            applications.

        <article class="backEnd">
          <p>
            A server-side API, also known as a backend API or server API, is an
            interface exposed by a server to allow client applications to
            interact with it and access its services or data. Unlike client-side
            APIs, which are executed within a web browser or client application,
            server-side APIs are executed on the server.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2 id="title">Key Characteristics of Server-Side APIs:</h2>
          <h3>Data Access and Manipulation:</h3>
          <p>
            Server-side APIs are commonly used to perform operations such as
            retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting data from a server-side
            database or other data sources.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Business Logic and Processing:</h3>
          <p>
            Server-side APIs often encapsulate business logic and processing
            logic to perform complex operations or calculations on the server,
            such as authentication, authorization, validation, and data
            processing.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Integration with External Services:</h3>
          <p>
            Server-side APIs facilitate integration with external services,
            allowing the server to communicate with other systems or services to
            perform tasks such as sending emails, processing payments, or
            accessing third-party APIs.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Security and Access Control:</h3>
          <p>
            Server-side APIs typically implement security mechanisms such as
            authentication and authorization to control access to resources and
            ensure that only authorized users or applications can access certain
            endpoints or perform specific actions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <br />

          <h2 id="title">Examples of Server-Side APIs:</h2>
          <h3>RESTful APIs:</h3>
          <p>
            Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are a common type of
            server-side API that follows the principles of REST architecture.
            They expose a set of endpoints (URLs) that clients can interact with
            using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD
            operations on resources.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>SOAP APIs:</h3>
          <p>
            Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) APIs are another type of
            server-side API that uses XML-based messaging protocol for
            communication between client and server. SOAP APIs often provide
            more rigid contracts and support for features such as encryption and
            transactions.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>GraphQL APIs:</h3>
          <p>
            GraphQL APIs allow clients to request specific data using a query
            language. The server responds with exactly the data requested by the
            client, providing a more flexible and efficient alternative to
            traditional REST APIs.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Custom Backend APIs:</h3>
          <p>
            Many web applications have custom backend APIs that are tailored to
            the specific needs of the application. These APIs expose endpoints
            for accessing application-specific functionality or data.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Server-side APIs play a crucial role in modern web development by
            enabling communication between client applications and server-side
            systems. They provide the foundation for building scalable, secure,
            and interoperable web applications that can integrate with a wide
            range of services and data sources.
